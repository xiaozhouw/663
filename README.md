# Sta-663 Final Project

## Project description
This project implements the memory sparse version of Viterbi algorithm and Baum-Welch algorithm to hidden Markov Model. The whole project is based on the paper ''Implementing EM and Viterbi algorithms for Hidden Markov Model in linear memory'', written by Alexander Churbanov and Stephen Winters-Hilt.
